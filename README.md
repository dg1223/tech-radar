# Emerging Technologies Radar

This is a Gartner influenced [emerging technologies radar](https://blogs.gartner.com/tuong-nguyen/2020/12/07/gartner-launches-emerging-technologies-radar-2021/) that tracks the progress of emerging technology research in an organization. It is a sample of the radar that we use at the IT branch at Canada Revenue Agency.

The canvas below and all of its contents have been automatically generated from a single spreadsheet. The technology names are automatically placed on the canvas without* hard coding any of their coordinates.

This is a work in progress. Below are the next steps:
- Add activity icons to each technology to track activity/deliverable level progress
- Automatically fine tune coordinates so that the titles and icons do not overlap
- Add legends and definitions
- Activate the buttons on the top right corner
- Make the web design responsive
- Create a webform and link it to the radar's backend to allow real-time updates
- Upgrade the spreadsheet to a database
- Use machine learning to tune all the parameters as new data comes in
  - There are 11 parameters that sometimes I need to tune manually (not all at the same time) to align items properly
