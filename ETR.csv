Adaptive Security Architecture,Study,,Engage,,Tech R&D,PoC (technology),Investigate and test Garrison Appliance for Isolate Web Facing technology           ,SID,Martin L,James Robichaud / Christina Pilon,Planned,,,"Isolation of Web Facing Technology is being considered as an Adaptive Security Architecure component.  The most common way of delivering Browser Isolation is Server-Side Browser Isolation. Server Side Browser Isolation delivers literal isolation of browsing activity, by physically isolating malware and cyber- attacks away from your networks and user machines. 
Server-Side models deliver a remote browser to their users, which is hosted on a physically isolated server built to handle cyber risks. This means that end users can continue to use the web without disruption, able to view dynamic web pages as they normally would, and use controls such as copy, paste and print.

Captcha Evolution,Study,,,,Tech R&D,Backgrounder,"Have you noticed that CAPTCHA tests have become increasingly hard to solve? That’s because bots are getting better at cracking those frustratingly difficult, warped word puzzles. According to research from Google, computers could solve the hardest distorted text CAPTCHAs with 99% accuracy, while humans could only solve with a 33% accuracy. This has led to increasingly difficult CAPTCHA tests that have significant accessibility issues for individuals who are blind, deaf or have cognitive impairments. In the future, CAPTCHAs will evolve into more sophisticated tests that only humans can pass. These tests need to be easy enough for any human to complete without compromising privacy or personally identifiable information such as a DNA sample or a fingerprint. With more and more sophisticated sensors being incorporated into our digital devices, what if CAPTCHAs evolve to be breathalyzers, body heat sensors or heartbeat monitors on your computer screen?",SAID,Tiffany B,Cheryl Cudmore,Planned,,,,06-08-2020,Megha Malhotra,,,,,,,,,2,2,

Ever since the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) tightened the bolts on privacy and data protection laws, businesses and consumers alike have become more aware of their vulnerability to data breaches and cyber-attacks.
According to Gartner, by 2020, nearly 70% of organizations will be exposed to personal data archiving. That’s a 60% growth since 2018 when the number was at 10%. 
In fact, emerging and upcoming technology trends like cryptocurrency will be one of those upcoming technologies that are yet to be compliant with privacy laws. An insertion of personal data into public blockchains can be a major worry for 75% of public blockchains by 2020. As a result, an entire ecosystem, based on data-driven technologies, that is constantly growing in its interconnections is a key tech trend that businesses can benefit from by forging early-on partnerships.",SAID,Tiffany B,TBD,Planned,,,,06-08-2020,Megha Malhotra,,,,,,,,,1,1,

Secure Hardware Systems,Study,,,,Tech R&D,Backgrounder,"Not all use cases for advanced data protection can be handled using software-based approaches. To address this gap, several emerging techniques protect privacy by securing the hardware environment instead. In such an environment, data processing is protected by virtue of the hardware being resistant to intrusion and tampering. E.g., portions of the processor memory may be “walled off” in such a way that not even privileged processes can access them or their data. This approach supports scenarios where data must be processed in untrusted environments, but not those that require actual data sharing.",SAID,Tiffany B,Cheryl Cudmore,Planned,,,,06-08-2020,Megha Malhotra,11-09-2020,Shamir Alavi,Shortened the title based on discussion with Kim (SC&D) and Yihong (SC&D),,,,,,2,2,

Encrypted portions of the data needed to perform the calculation are divided among multiple participants. Thus, if data from only one or a minority of the participating nodes becomes compromised, this still does not yield any useful information to attackers.
