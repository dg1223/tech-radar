Adaptive Security Architecture,Study,,Engage,,Tech R&D,PoC (technology),Investigate and test Garrison Appliance for Isolate Web Facing technology           ,SID,Martin L,Christina Pilon,Planned,,,"Isolation of Web Facing Technology is being considered as an Adaptive Security Architecure component.  The most common way of delivering Browser Isolation is Server-Side Browser Isolation. Server Side Browser Isolation delivers literal isolation of browsing activity, by physically isolating malware and cyber- attacks away from your networks and user machines. 
Server-Side models deliver a remote browser to their users, which is hosted on a physically isolated server built to handle cyber risks. This means that end users can continue to use the web without disruption, able to view dynamic web pages as they normally would, and use controls such as copy, paste and print.

",SID,Martin L,Steve Maganas,Planned,,,"Once developed, quantum computers will perform certain mathematical calculations much faster than current technology. They will be able to compromise the algorithms used in asymmetric cryptography in a very short timeframe compared to today’s computers. It is expected that a quantum computer capable of defeating asymmetric cryptography will come online in as little as 10 to 15 years. This means that all present day classified (and sensitive) GC information and communications, especially that with a medium to long-term intelligence life, could be vulnerable to the quantum threat while it is still relevant and useful from an intelligence perspective.
